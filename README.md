Usage
-----

To regenerate the PDFs, ensure Coq, QuickChick, and LaTeX are installed, then:

```
$ make
```

### Notes

The [Makefiles](src/Makefile.patch) are patched during the build process, so that chapters are generated in the right order, and the LaTeX nesting limit is not reached.

Similarly, the [Typeclasses](src/Typeclasses.v.patch) and [QuickChickTool](src/QuickChickTool.v.patch) chapters of the QuickChick book are patched, so that a diacritic does not confuse LaTeX, and code listings appear in the output as intended.
